Linear separability through <I>k</I>-means' center-based mechanism

These HTML5 codes do 2 things:

1. Lets you to add points on the canvas and show the center the points.
   - Two groups of points can be added. One green (Add pos data) and one red (Add neg data)
      
2. Lets you draw two points (Set center 1 and Set center 2 respectively) on the canvas and shows a divider line according to the <I>k</I>-means algorithm.<BR/>


This will help you better understand how <i>k</i>-means works and why its problem is not just with linear separability, but also with its center-based divider mechanism.
